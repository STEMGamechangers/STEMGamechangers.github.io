        Below are some challenges that we - <a href="/team">the organising team</a> - are thinking about. We've split them into a few different categories: <a href="#genderequality">gender equality</a>, <a href="#sexualabuse">sexual abuse</a>, <a href="#women">women and gender minorities</a>, <a href="#lgbtq">LGBTQ+</a>, <a href="#bame">black and minority ethnic</a> and <a href="#disabled">disabled</a> people, and <a href="#initatives">managing diversity initatives</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="blackp">
         We would love for some of your proposed initiatives to aim to improve one or more of the points below, but this is absolutely a <strong>non-exhaustive</strong> list! Your focus is very welcome.
