- question: "Can we talk about what we are doing?"
  answer: 'YES! We want to show off all your ideas. The goal of the event is to draw attention to your initiatives (new and ongoing) and build more awareness around the need for improverments around diversity in STEM.<br><br>

  We have a twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/STEMGamechange">@STEMGamechange</a> and a hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/STEMGamechangers">#STEMGamechangers</a> and we would love for you to share your stories through the two days (and beyond!).<br><br>

  HOWEVER, you must also abide by the <a href="https://bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct">code of conduct</a> and <strong>do not share information - including photographs - about someone else</strong> if they have not given you permission. This includes their experiences and stories, and might include details of your project. It is up to your team to agree on what details you are comfortable sharing publicly.'

- question: "Video recording and photographs"
  answer: 'The wonderful <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/business-team/dan-whitfield">Dan</a> and <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/business-team/chizom-ekeh">Chizom</a> will be making a video recording of the event. They will be recording mini interviews (just 5 minutes of your time) on Friday afternoon. Let one of the organisers know if you would like to be interviewed.<br><br>

  Dan, Chizom and our photographer Arif will be around over both days taking pictures of the event. <strong>If you do not want to appear in the video or a photograph please make sure you are wearing a red lanyard</strong>. That will make it really easy to make sure you are not in any of the clips or pictures.<br><br>

  Arif will also be taking <strong>professional headshots</strong> for anyone who would like one. Just find him during lunch on Friday (or if you catch him roaming around!)'
