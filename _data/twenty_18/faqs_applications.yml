- question: "Why are you holding this event on a weekend? It is difficult for people with caring responsibilties to attend!"
  answer: "This is absolutely true, and something we considered when we were building the event. We know that it's hard for parents to join events that are outside of school hours (evenings and weekends for example) but also that some people who work in tech aren't able to contribute to these initiatives during their work hours! <br><br>We decided to split the difference: Gamechangers is held on a Friday and a Saturday. If you're only able to attend one day, that's absolutely fine, please just say so in <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciwVhefx-feE_EYsOXmjK0sc7bnzv38BfQ75n_4OkcqTa-tA/viewform'>your application</a>. Alternatively, we have funding available for childcare and we would be delighted to help support you where we can. There's a space to apply for funding on the application form, or you can get in touch via our <a href='/#contact'>contact page</a>."

- question: "Is the event free?"
  answer: "Yes, there is no charge to attend!
  We are asking people to apply via our website though because spaces are limited."

- question: "When will I find out whether my application has been accepted?"
  answer: "We will review all applications after the deadline and you will hear whether or not your application has been accepted by the end of August."
