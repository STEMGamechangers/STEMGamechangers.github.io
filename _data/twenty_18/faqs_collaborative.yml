- question: Do you have a code of conduct?
  answer: "Yes! All attendees are expected to read our <a href='http://bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct'>code of conduct</a> in advance of their arrival. It is available as a google doc at <a href='http://bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct'>bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct</a> so that we can incorporate our participants' feedback and suggestions. Our goal is to build a set of community norms rather than dictate our expectations from on hight.<br><br>

  Gamechangers for Diversity in STEM is an inclusive event where people should feel comfortable sharing their work, opinions, and perspectives. We ask that all participants commit to engaging with each other mindfully to ensure an environment that promotes shared learning and collaboration.<br><br>

  The short version of the Gamechangers Code of Conduct is that we are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion."

- question: Why are you giving prizes if you want to run a collaborative event?
  answer: "Great question! Our goal for this event is absolutely to signal boost all the wonderful ideas and initiatives that our participants are already leading. To super charge them by providing mentorship and building connections between similar projects within the network. We're very confident that <strong>all of the pitches</strong> will be fascinating and contain really excellent ideas.<br><br>

  Thanks to the generosity of <a href='../#sponsors'>our sponsors</a> we did consider giving everyone a prize! Ultimately though, we've decided to reward the top 3-4 project teams with prizes between £500 and £1000 to allow them to quickly take their concept forward. Beyond the financial prize, we also want those awards to be symbols of our judging panel's endorsement that these were <strong>evidence-based</strong> and <strong>practical</strong> ways to build more inclusive environments in STEM."

- question: "How should we communicate?"
  answer: "We hope you'll have lots of fun chatting in person, but the <a href='https://stemgamechangers.slack.com/'>Slack workspace</a> should also be a useful. We want to make it easy for you to chat when the teams are in different rooms, and also to stay in touch with you after the event!"
