- question: Do you have a code of conduct?
  answer: "Yes! All attendees are expected to read our <a href='http://bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct'>code of conduct</a> in advance of their arrival. It is available as a google doc at <a href='http://bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct'>bit.ly/GamechangersCodeOfConduct</a> so that we can incorporate our participants' feedback and suggestions. Our goal is to build a set of community norms rather than dictate our expectations from on hight.<br><br>

  Gamechangers for Diversity in STEM is an inclusive event where people should feel comfortable sharing their work, opinions, and perspectives. We ask that all participants commit to engaging with each other mindfully to ensure an environment that promotes shared learning and collaboration.<br><br>

  The short version of the Gamechangers Code of Conduct is that we are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion."
