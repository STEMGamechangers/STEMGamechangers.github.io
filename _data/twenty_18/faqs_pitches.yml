- question: What is a pitch?
  answer: "On Saturday afternoon we will be joined by invited guests who are interested in supporting the initiatives developed by the Gamechangers teams. Each group will have (a strictly timed!) 5 minutes to share their proposal.<br><br>

  Teams are welcome to use these 5 minutes as they would like. We will be recording the pitches and sharing them on our website after the event (along with the team members and , so we recommend that teams spend at least a little time polishing their presentation. We hope that the recording will be useful for the group members to promote their idea after the end of the two day Gamechangers event.<br><br>"

- question: Why are you giving prizes if you want to run a collaborative event?
  answer: "Great question! Our goal for this event is absolutely to signal boost all the wonderful ideas and initiatives that our participants are already leading. To super charge them by providing mentorship and building connections between similar projects within the network. We're very confident that <strong>all of the pitches</strong> will be fascinating and contain really excellent ideas.<br><br>

  Thanks to the generosity of <a href='../#sponsors'>our sponsors</a> we did consider giving everyone a prize! Ultimately though, we've decided to reward the top 3-4 project teams with prizes between £500 and £1000 to allow them to quickly take their concept forward. Beyond the financial prize, we also want those awards to be symbols of our judging panel's endorsement that these were <strong>evidence-based</strong> and <strong>practical</strong> ways to build more inclusive environments in STEM."
