                It looks really great, but I don't know which video we'd add!

                We will begin with some inspiring keynote talks from leaders of successful grassroots diversity initiatives. These talks will then serve as a catalyst for two days of group-based deliberation, development and design of potential projects. You will decide what you want to work on, either by proposing your own idea as a project or joining a team working on something which particularly inspires you. At the end of the event, groups will have a unique opportunity to pitch their projects to companies who share our goals in transforming the STEM working environment.

                If you’re passionate about diversity in STEM and want to work on projects to make a real difference, we invite you to join us. Together we can be the gamechangers of tomorrow.


                 <p>
                   Across STEM people face many challenges: professional isolation, sexual harassment and bullying, and difficulties balancing work and family. These sorts of experiences disproportionately affect women, people from ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ+ community and disabled people.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   At STEM Gamechangers we invite you to join us to build a fresh, bold vision for a more inclusive environment in STEM. How? By working on evidence-based, practical solutions. Across the UK many people are already working hard to create and support diversity within their own institutions and workplaces. However, there is often little to no support or funding and their efforts can be under appreciated. By coming together we can change this, inspire each other and create new collaborations and opportunities.
