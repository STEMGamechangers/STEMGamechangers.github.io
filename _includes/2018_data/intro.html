        <p>
          Across STEM people face many challenges: professional isolation, sexual harassment and bullying, and difficulties balancing work and family. These sorts of experiences disproportionately affect <strong>women</strong>, <strong>people from ethnic minorities</strong>, the <strong>LGBTQ+ community</strong> and <strong>disabled people</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At STEM Gamechangers we <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciwVhefx-feE_EYsOXmjK0sc7bnzv38BfQ75n_4OkcqTa-tA/viewform">invite you to join us</a> to build a fresh, bold vision for a more inclusive environment in STEM.
        </p>
        <p>
          How? By working on <strong>evidence-based</strong>, <strong>practical</strong> solutions. Across the UK many people are already working hard to create and support diversity within their own institutions and workplaces. However, there is often <strong>little to no support or funding</strong> and their efforts can be under appreciated. <strong>By coming together we can change this</strong>, inspire each other and create new collaborations and opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will begin with some <a href=#speakers>inspiring keynote talks</a> from leaders of successful grassroots diversity initiatives. These talks will then serve as a catalyst for <strong>two days of group-based deliberation, development and design of potential projects</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will decide what you want to work on, either by <strong>proposing your own idea</strong> as a project or <strong>joining a team</strong> working on something which particularly inspires you.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the event, groups will have a unique opportunity to <strong>pitch their projects</strong> to companies who share our goals in transforming the STEM working environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If youâ€™re passionate about diversity in STEM and want to work on projects to make a real difference, <a href="">please apply to join us</a> today.</strong>
          </p>
